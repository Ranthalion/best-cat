# Introduction to Mock Service Worker

## What's this about

Mock Service Worker (msw) is a package that mocks Rest and GraphQL requests by intercepting traffic on a network level.  It can run in the browser as well as in the node runtime.

## OK. So what?  What does that mean to me?

- Simulate backend APIs for faster iteration and testing
- Allows offline development and testing
- Share fixtures between local development, unit test, e2e tests and anything else in the application.
- Total control over the API responses can replicate edge cases and bugs
- Get work done without worrying about the pesky back end or finding sample data
