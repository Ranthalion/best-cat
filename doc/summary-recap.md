# Summary

We implemented msw with Angular by installing msw, defining mock handlers, and starting the service worker from the environment file.  
  
We also exposed msw to the browswer.  This allowed us to override the default handler with a single use handler to test specific scenarios.

I hope you found the information about MSW valuable and insightful.  I believe that by incorporating MSW into your projects, you can achieve greater control, productivity, and independence in your frontend development. I hope you're excited about the possibilities that MSW offers and that you'll consider adopting it to improve your frontend development and testing practices.

THE END!
